    "I will refer to income class >50K as high income and income class <50K as low income. Based on the histograms we can observe the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the feature of age, there is a moderate level of overlap between the classes. However, the high income class is more probabable with middle age. That is, for age < 30, it is more probable to be low income. For age, 35 < age < 60, it is more probable to be high income, although there is a decent amount of overlap with low income within these ages. For older ages, age > 60, there is just as much chance of being high income as there is of being low income (lots of overlap). Overall, age is moderately predictive to income class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For the feature fnlwgt, there is overlap for most of the chart. Overall, fnlwgt is not predictive to income class, as there is no trend in which either class is more probable\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For the feature education.num, there is moderate to little level of overlap between the classes. Low income is more probable at lower values of education.num <= 9-10. High income is far more probable at high levels, education.num > 12. There is a little bit of overlap at mid-level education num of 9-12. Overall, education.num is fairly good in predicting income class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For the feature capital.gain, most of the the observations are around 0, however, for non-zero values it is very probable that it is high income. Thus, capital.gain could give some predictive value as most non-zero capital gain is by high income.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For the feature capital.loss, simlar to capital.gain, most of the observations are around 0. However, there aren't that many non-zero observations and a larger portion of the high income class is near 0 (unlike the capital.gain chart). The few non-zero values have a very strong probability of being high income. Thus, capital.loss could give some predictive value as almost all non-zero capital gain is by high income.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. For the hours.per.week feature, most of the observations are concentrated on 40 for both high income and low income. However, low income is more concentrated at 40 and high income has more probability in cases where hours.per.week > 40. Also low income has more probability in cases where hours.per.week < 40. Overall, hours.per.week is moderately predictive to income class.\n"

In terms of our goal, not following the golden rule could hurt the generalizing ability of the classifier and hence give us a worse classifier.\n",
